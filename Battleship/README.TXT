PROJECT TITLE: Battleship
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: AP Computer Science Capstone
VERSION or DATE: 5/11/16
DEPENDENCIES: None
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
AUTHORS: David Fei
USER INSTRUCTIONS:
When first running the game, it may freeze upon pressing the start button or not let you set all the tiles for a ship.
The reason for this is currently unknown. 
If this happens, simply reset the Java Virtual Machine and restart the program. 

TILE ID VALUES (all values are int primitives)
Ocean = 0
Battleship = 1
Destroyer = 2
Patrol boat = 3

Overview:
This application is a PC version of the classic board game Battleship, made using the Java standard library.
The current version only supports singleplayer human vs computer games.

Concepts used:
This program synthesizes both object-oriented design and GUI design. It also makes use of data structures such as arrays
to keep track of all the tiles for each player's game board as well as the ships on the board, and utilizes class design
concepts such as encapsulation.  It also incorporates the most basic concepts such as loops, boolean logic, and object references.
I had to do additional research on Java layout managers in order to position objects within my GUI properly, and made use of new
concepts such as the GridLayout manager and absolute positioning based on coordinates within the window to make the GUI 
look more organized and visually appeasing.
